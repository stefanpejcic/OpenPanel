## What is OpenPanel?

OpenPanel is a powerful and flexible web hosting control panel for Linux systems. Available in a community-supported version and a feature-rich version with premium support, OpenPanel is a cost-effective and comprehensive solution for web hosting management.

**OpenPanel** offers a distinct advantage over other hosting panels by providing each user with an isolated environment and tools to fully manage it. This ensures full control over your environment, similar to a VPS experience. You can effortlessly run multiple PHP versions, modify server configurations, view domain logs, restart services, and perform numerous other advanced tasks.

Deliver a **VPS-like experience** to your users at a fraction of the cost, with all-inclusive features such as **resource limiting, user isolation, WP Manager, and enhanced security** seamlessly integrated for worry-free hosting.

This panel is the culmination of years of experience in the hosting industry. Having spent decades working with various hosting panels, we made sure to include all features that simply make sense.

When designing OpenPanel, we prioritized features that are not only user-friendly for beginners but also advanced enough to alleviate maintenance tasks for system administrators and hosting support teams.

## OpenPanel vs OpenAdmin

The **OpenAdmin** interface is designed for administrators to efficiently handle tasks such as creating and managing users, setting up hosting plans, configuring backups, and editing OpenPanel settings.

The **OpenPanel** interface is the client-level panel where end-users can manage their environment, edit settings, install services, create websites, and more.

## What Do You Mean by 'Open'?

Open for business!

OpenPanel is the first truly modular panel where [absolutely everything is customizable](https://openpanel.com/docs/articles/dev-experience/customizing-openpanel-user-interface/) and works independently of the rest of the system. It is also OS-agnostic and works the same on all supported systems.

However, OpenPanel is **not** an open-source project. The primary reason behind this decision is our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security for our users, which we can only achieve with closed-source and controlled contributions.

While OpenPanel itself is not 100% open source, we are committed to transparency and security:

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

### Installation Issues

- **Error: "You must be root to execute this script."**
  - Ensure you are running the installation script as the root user or with `sudo`.

- **Error: "Unsupported Operating System."**
  - Verify that your OS is listed in the [Supported Operating Systems](#supported-operating-systems) section.

- **Error: "Running inside a container is not supported."**
  - OpenPanel does not support installation inside Docker or LXC containers. Use a dedicated VPS or server.

### Service Issues

- **OpenAdmin is not accessible on port 2087.**
  - Check if the service is running: `systemctl status admin`.
  - Ensure port 2087 is open in your firewall settings.

- **MySQL container fails to start.**
  - Verify that Docker is installed and running.
  - Check the logs for errors: `docker logs <container_id>`.

### General Issues

- **SSL certificate is not generated.**
  - Ensure your hostname is a valid FQDN and DNS is correctly configured.
  - Restart the Caddy service: `docker compose restart caddy`.

- **Quota setup fails.**
  - Ensure `usrquota` and `grpquota` are enabled in `/etc/fstab` and remount the filesystem.
