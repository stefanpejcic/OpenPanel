## What is OpenPanel

OpenPanel is a powerful and flexible web hosting control panel for Linux systems. Available in a community-supported version and a more feature-filled version with premium support, OpenPanel is the cost-effective and comprehensive solution to web hosting management.

**OpenPanel** offers a distinct advantage over other hosting panels by providing each user with an isolated environment and tools to fully manage it. This ensures that you enjoy full control over your environment, similar to a VPS experience. You can effortlessly run multiple PHP versions, modify server configurations, view domain logs, restart services, and perform numerous other advanced tasks.

Deliver a **VPS-like experience** to your users at a fraction of the cost, with all-inclusive features such as **resource limiting, user isolation, WP Manager, and enhanced security** seamlessly integrated for worry-free hosting.

This panel is the culmination of years of experience in the hosting industry, having spent decades working with various hosting panels we made sure to include all features that simply make sense.

When we designed OpenPanel, we prioritized features that are not only user-friendly for beginners but also advanced enough to alleviate maintenance tasks for system administrators and hosting support teams.

Some of the features worth mentioning are:

- Users can run [Nginx or Apache webserver](https://openpanel.com/docs/admin/plans/hosting_plans/#list-hosting-plans).
- Users can run [MySQL or MariaDB](https://openpanel.com/docs/articles/docker/how-to-set-mysql-mariadb-per-user-in-openpanel/).
- Users can [install PHP versions](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#install-php-version) they need, [edit php.ini files](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#phpini-editor), and set desired limits.
- Control [MySQL settings](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#mysql-settings), set limits, [enable remote MySQL access](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/databases/remote), and much more.
- [Update system services](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#service-status) and even install new services that they need.
- Manage WordPress websites easily with [WP Manager](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/applications/wordpress).
- Password-less login to [phpMyAdmin](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/databases/phpmyadmin) and [Web Terminal](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/advanced/terminal).
- Built-in [REDIS](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/caching/Redis) and [Memcached](https://openpanel.com/docs/panel/caching/Memcached) object caching.

And unique features that simply made sense üíÅ to us:
- User and admin panels are completely isolated when needed.
- SSL is automatically generated and renewed.
- Services auto-start only when needed so resources are not wasted.
- Google PageSpeed data is automatically displayed for every website in Site Manager.
- Users can export DNS zones easily.
- Users can pause cronjobs when not needed.
- Users can suspend websites.
- Administrators can receive daily usage reports.
- Users can add comments for DNS records.
- Download files from URL in File Manager.
- Users can save pages to Favorites.
- Users can view all active sessions.
- Users can share web terminal sessions with third parties.
- Detailed activity log of all actions.
- Admins can add custom messages per user.
- Enhanced validation and error handling for seamless installation.
- Fedora support added for broader compatibility.
- and a lot more üôå

## OpenPanel vs OpenAdmin

The **OpenAdmin** offers an administrator-level interface where you can efficiently handle tasks such as creating and managing users, setting up hosting plans, configuring backups, and editing OpenPanel settings.

The **OpenPanel** interface is the client-level panel where end-users can manage their environment, edit settings, install services, create websites, and more.

## Supported OS

OpenPanel is a truly [OS-agnostic](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/agnostic) control panel.

| **Officially Supported OS** | **Community Supported OS**                                   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu 24.04                | Ubuntu 22.04 *(Looking for maintainers)*                     |
| Fedora 38                   | AlmaLinux 9 *(Looking for maintainers)*                      |
|                             | RockyLinux 9 *(Looking for maintainers)*                     |
|                             | CentOS 9.4 *(Looking for maintainers)*                       |
|                             | Debian 11, 12 *(Looking for maintainers)*                    |

## What do you mean by 'open'?

Open for business!

OpenPanel is the first truly modular panel where [absolutely everything is customizable](https://openpanel.com/docs/articles/dev-experience/customizing-openpanel-user-interface/) and works independently of the rest of the system. It is also OS-agnostic and works the same on all supported systems.

However, OpenPanel is **not** an open-source project. The primary reason behind this decision is our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security for our users, which we can only achieve with closed-source and controlled contributions.

While OpenPanel itself is not 100% open source, we are committed to transparency and security:

## Compatibility Notes
When upgrading from versions prior to 1.1.8, please note the following compatibility considerations:

1. Custom PHP configurations may need adjustments due to the new PHP-FPM pooling mechanism
2. Legacy Apache configuration imports require the new migration tool (see docs/migrations/apache_config.md)
3. MySQL database connections now default to using TLS/SSL; modify connection strings if needed
4. API authentication tokens from versions before 1.1.5 will need to be regenerated
5. Custom themes should be tested with the new theme compatibility checker before upgrading

For detailed migration guidance, please refer to our [Upgrade Guide](https://openpanel.com/docs/admin/upgrade_guide).
