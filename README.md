## What is OpenPanel

**OpenPanel** offers a distinct advantage over other hosting panels by providing each user with an isolated environment and tools to fully manage it. This ensures that you enjoy full control over your environment, simillar to a VPS experience. You can effortlessly install new PHP versions, modify server configurations, view domain logs, restart services, and perform numerous other advanced tasks.

This panel is the culmination of years of experience in the hosting industry, having spent decades working with various hosting panels we made sure to include all features that simply make sense.

When we designed OpenPanel, we prioritized features that are not only user-friendly for beginners but also advanced enough to alleviate maintenance tasks for system administrators and hosting support teams.

Some of the unique features worth mentioning are:

- You can [install PHP versions](/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#install-php-version) you need, [edit php.ini files](/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#phpini-editor) and set desired limits.
- Control [MySQL settings](/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#mysql-settings), set limits, [enable remote mysql access](/docs/panel/databases/remote) and much more.
- [Update system services](/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#service-status) and even install new services that you need.
- Manage WordPress websites easily with [WP Manager](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress).
- Password-less login to [phpMyAdmin](/docs/panel/databases/phpmyadmin) and [Web Terminal](/docs/panel/advanced/terminal).
- Built-in [REDIS](/docs/panel/caching/Redis) and [Memcached](/docs/panel/caching/Memcached) object caching.

## OpenPanel vs OpenAdmin


The **OpenAdmin* offers an administrator-level interface where you can efficiently handle tasks such as creating and managing users, setting up hosting plans, configuring backups, and editing OpenPanel settings.
The **OpenPanel** interface is the client-level panel where end-users can manage their enviroment, edit settings, install services, create websites and more.
