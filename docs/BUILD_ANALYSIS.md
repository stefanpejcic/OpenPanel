# Build Analysis and Recommendations

After examining the build, installation, and update scripts along with the documentation files, here is the summary:

- **Build Structure:**  
  Installation and update processes are driven by shell scripts (INSTALL.sh and UPDATE.sh) spread across multiple version directories. They use Docker (with docker-compose), package managers, and license verification steps.

- **Repetitive Code:**  
  Many scripts repeat similar steps:
  • Creating admin accounts with varying messages  
  • Installing firewall services (CSF/UFW)  
  • Pulling and restarting Docker images  
  • Checking service statuses and rolling back updates if necessary

- **Documentation:**  
  Markdown files provide detailed changelogs, post-install steps, and admin configuration instructions. They help highlight new features, bug fixes, and security improvements (for example, enabling HTTPS and integrating CorazaWAF).

- **Recommendations:**  
  1. **Consolidation:** Factor out common routines (e.g., Docker image updates, license verification, and error handling) into shared functions or library scripts.  
  2. **Centralized Update Handling:** Merge update logic to reduce divergence among versions and simplify maintenance.  
  3. **Improved Diagnostics:** Standardize logging and error messaging to aid troubleshooting during build and update.  
  4. **Documentation Consistency:** Ensure versioned docs follow a consistent style and clearly indicate build/deployment changes.

This analysis should serve as a guide to refactor and streamline the build process while maintaining detailed version history and security best practices.

## Next Steps: Consolidated Build Process

To streamline builds and reduce repetition, we recommend creating a shared script that encapsulates common build routines (e.g. Docker installation, daemon checks, image pulling, and docker-compose startup). This script can be invoked by the various INSTALL.sh and UPDATE.sh files across versions.

This shared script (see below) will:
- Validate and start Docker and docker-compose.
- Pull needed Docker images.
- Restart containers with a unified logging mechanism.
- Handle errors and provide rollback information.

By centralizing these functions, maintenance becomes easier and consistency is ensured across builds.

## Rollout and Testing

Before full adoption:
- Test the consolidated script in a staging environment.
- Validate that the common routines work well with all versions.
- Adjust error handling or rollback mechanisms as needed.
