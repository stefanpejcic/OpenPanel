### allinurl/goaccess

GoAccess is no longer directly installed on the server; instead, it [runs as a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/allinurl/goaccess) when necessary. This setup ensures that resources are utilized only when required and prevents any utilization of system services during idle periods. When collecting domain statistics, one container is initiated per domain name.


### opencli docker

Several new OpenCLI commands are now available to manage the Docker service:

- To collect docker resource usage information (cpu, ram, i/o) for all users:
  ```bash
  opencli docker-collect_stats
  ```
- Set global docker limits (ram and cpu) for all containers combined.
  ```bash
  opencli docker-limits [--apply | --read]
  ```
- Download [official docker images](https://dev.openpanel.co/images/browse.html) for OpenPanel:
  ```bash
  opencli docker-update_images
  ```
- Rotate resource usage logs for all users according to the [resource_usage_retention](https://dev.openpanel.co/cli/commands.html#resource-usage-retention) setting.
  ```bash
  opencli docker-usage_stats_cleanup
  ```
