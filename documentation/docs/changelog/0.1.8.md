### Docker Resources

Administrators now have the ability to set the maximum percentage of CPU and Memory resources that all Docker containers combined can utilize on the server.

By default, this setting is configured to 90%, safeguarding against Docker monopolizing 100% of available resources and rendering the server inaccessible.

Please note: Memory usage is saved in gigabytes (GB), not as a percentage. Therefore, if the server's RAM is increased, the memory allocation settings will need to be adjusted accordingly.

### PHP Composer

Composer command is now available in both openpanel/nginx and openpanel/apache docker images.

### opencli user-sudo

Administrators can now grant root-level (sudo) permissions to users inside their docker containers.

- Check current sudo status:
  ```bash
  opencli user-sudo USERNAME status
  ```
- Grant sudo privilegies:
  ```bash
  opencli user-sudo USERNAME enable
  ```
- Remove sudo privilegies:
  ```bash
  opencli user-sudo USERNAME disable
  ```


### allinurl/goaccess

GoAccess is no longer directly installed on the server; instead, it [runs as a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/allinurl/goaccess) when necessary. This setup ensures that resources are utilized only when required and prevents any utilization of system services during idle periods. When collecting domain statistics, one container is initiated per domain name.


### Exclude backups

You can disable individual user accounts from all backup jobs by including them in the file `usr/local/admin/scripts/helpers/excluded_from_backups.txt`.

### opencli docker

Several new OpenCLI commands are now available to manage the Docker service:

- To collect docker resource usage information (cpu, ram, i/o) for all users:
  ```bash
  opencli docker-collect_stats
  ```
- Set global docker limits (ram and cpu) for all containers combined.
  ```bash
  opencli docker-limits [--apply | --read]
  ```
- Download [official docker images](https://dev.openpanel.co/images/browse.html) for OpenPanel:
  ```bash
  opencli docker-update_images
  ```
- Rotate resource usage logs for all users according to the [resource_usage_retention](https://dev.openpanel.co/cli/commands.html#resource-usage-retention) setting.
  ```bash
  opencli docker-usage_stats_cleanup
  ```
