##### BasicAuth for OpenAdmin

As an additional security measure, [BasicAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) can be enabled for OpenAdmin panel. [Instruction](/docs/admin/scripts/openpanel_config/#admin_template)

API access is automatically disabled when BasicAuth is enabled.

To enable basic authentication for OpenAdmin, run commands:

`opencli config update basic_auth yes`

`opencli config update basic_auth_username STRONG_USERNAME_HERE`

`opencli config update basic_auth_password STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE`


then reload the OpenAdmin service:

`service admin reload`
