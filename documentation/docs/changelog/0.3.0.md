### 💅 Polish
- Support for [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000) and [HTTP/3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114) - automatically enabled for new domains that use SSL.
- FTP sub-accounts are now restricted to their designated directories and are in the same group as OpenPanel user, allowing them to access and edit files without issues.
- Added browser validation and password generation to [OpenPanel > FTP Accounts > Change password](https://i.postimg.cc/NjGsNdRJ/2024-09-13-07-40.png) form.
