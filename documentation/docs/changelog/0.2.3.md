### 💅 Polish

- All new user accounts now have fixed ports for MySQL and SSH services, so the ports remain consistent even after a restore or server reboot.
- Nginx and Apache vhosts files now restrict access to sensitive resources by default, these include: `.git`, `compose.json`, `composer.lock`, `auth.json`, `config.php`, `wp-config.php`, `vendor`. OpenPanel users can edit and remove the rules for any domain, from the **OpenPanel > Domains > Edit Vhosts File** page.
- PM2 Application installer now supports optional flags to be passed to the startup file.
- [Websites List](#websites-list)
- `opencli report` command now provides more detailed info for OpenAdmin service: pip installed packages, python version, ufw/csf rules and full error log.
- `opencli user-sudo` command now allows user to use the `su -` command to switch to root user.


### ConfigServer Firewall

ConfigServer Firewall is now the default firewall manager for OpenPanel. UFW can still be selected with the `--ufw` flag on installation.

### Upload URL

In **OpenPanel > File Manager**, click on "Upload." In the modal, select "Download from URL," then add the link and click the "Download" button.

This feature accepts any link type. If the link points to an archive *(`.zip`, `.tgz`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar`, `.gz`), it will automatically be extracted; if it's a regular file, it will simply be downloaded.

### AutoInstaller

Administrators can choose which CMS/tools to allow for the AutoInstaller interface from the **OpenAdmin > General Settings** page.

We also receive frequent questions from new users on how to upload a website, as they often get confused by the *New Website* modal. To address this, we added an option to choose between using the Autoinstaller or manually adding files and databases:

### Site Manager

Mautic Manager, WordPress Manager, and PM2 (NodeJS & Python) are now combined in a single interface named **Site Manager**.
