### OpenPanel Blacklist

OpenPanel Blacklist shows top 10000 IP addresses that are currently involved *(in last 12hr) with attacks to OpenPanel servers.

The list is auto-generated from the data collected by Sentinel service. Data is checked against other blacklists in order to avoid any false-positives and provide always up-to-date information.

URL: https://api.openpanel.co/blocklist.txt
