# 0.2.8

Not yet released.

### 🚀 New features
- [18 new sub-commands for managing mailserver using `opencli email-server`](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/email.html#MailServer)
- [13 new sub-commands for managing dns using `opencli domains-dns`](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/domains.html#DNS)
- [`opencli php-ini`](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/php.html#PHP-INI)

### 🐛 Bug fixes
- Fixed bug with invalid serial number format in bind9 zone files for domains.
- Fixed bug with `"` automatically applied to all TXT records that breaks DKIM validity.
- Fixed a bug where domains couldn't be deleted from *OpenPanel > Domains* if the associated website was removed within the last 5 minutes. Deleting a website now immediately invalidates the cache.
- Fixed broken css on Flarum from autoinstaller because of setting http:// in Flarum configuration.
- Fixed bug with Flarum autoinstaller not using provided admin username and always setting 'admin' instead.
- Fixed bug with Mautic autoinstaller not using provided admin username and always setting 'admin' instead.
- Fixed bug with the update_check script and added alternative server for updates.
- Fixed bug within dockerfile for `openpanel/nginx-mariadb:latest` image that caused failed build step.
- Fixed bug with limiting port speed on AlmaLinux, due to the tc command missing.
- Fixed bug with `opencli ssl-hostname` refusing to generate ssl if admin service is failed.
- Fixed bug with `opencli php-ioncube` command not extracting files.
- Fixed bug with Sentinel service displaying false-positive for domains that use Cloudflare proxy on AlmaLinux when dig (bind-utils package) is not installed.

### 💅 Polish
- Update script will now [create a log file of each update attempt and write a notification in OpenAdmin dashboard](https://i.postimg.cc/sXvkNFKv/2024-08-30-20-33.png).
- Added timeouts to all external curl and wget calls from opencli scripts.
- Improved [opencli files-fix_permissions](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/files.html#Fix-Permissions) script will now add permissions for groups as well and run commands in parallel to speed-up the process.
- `bash` is replaced with `sh` in all opencli scripts, so we have support for alpine containers.
