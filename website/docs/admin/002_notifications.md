# Notifications

Notifications are accessible via the 'Notifications' menu item in OpenAdmin.

![notifications center](/img/admin/notifications_center.png)

OpenPanel tracks and notifies you of these events:

* Server reboot
* Service inactivity
* Available updates
* Admin login from a new IP address
* SSH login from a new IP address
* High memory usage
* High average load
* High CPU usage
* High disk usage
* High swap usage
* DNS changes

Each notification type can be individually disabled, and admins can set custom threshold limits.

To manage notification settings, click the **Settings** button on the Notifications page or navigate to: [Settings > Notifications](/docs/admin/settings/notifications).
