# Email Accounts

The Emails section provides an overview of all email accounts managed through OpenPanel.

Use this interface to review usage, access webmail, and manage user-level email settings.

The table includes the following information:

- **Email** – The full email address of the account.
- **Quota** – The storage limit assigned to the account.
- **Webmail** – A quick-access button to log in directly to the webmail interface for that account.

This section is useful for monitoring email resource usage and offering users easy access to their inbox.
