Changes to this service will interrupt current email traffic and restart the mailserver.




## Relay Hosts

The **Relay Hosts** feature allows you to configure an SMTP relay service (also known as a relay host or smarthost) for relaying (forwarding) outbound email on behalf of third parties. This service does not manage mail domains but helps in routing emails through an external SMTP server.

This feature is useful for organizations that need to route their outgoing email traffic through a trusted third-party service or SMTP server for better deliverability and security.

The following parameters are used to configure the relay host settings:

- **DEFAULT_RELAY_HOST**  
  Default relay host for outgoing emails. This should match the **RELAY_HOST**.
  - Example: `mail.example.com`

- **RELAY_HOST**  
  The SMTP relay host that all outbound emails will be routed through.
  - Example: `mail.example.com`

- **RELAY_PORT**  
  The port to be used for connecting to the SMTP relay host.
  - Example: `25`

- **RELAY_USER (optional)**  
  The username for authenticating with the relay host. If this is set, secure connections will be required for outbound mail traffic.
  - Example: `relay_user`

- **RELAY_PASSWORD**  
  The password for authenticating with the relay host, used alongside the **RELAY_USER**.
  - Example: `relay_password`

When both **RELAY_USER** and **RELAY_PASSWORD** are configured, all outbound mail traffic will require a secure connection and the credentials will be mandatory.

Once configured, click the **Save Relay** button to apply the settings and begin routing outbound emails through the specified relay host.
