# Update Preferences


The Update Preferences page in OpenPanel allows you to manage and control how updates are applied. It is organized into three sections: Current Version, Auto Updates, and Update Logs.

## Current Version
This section displays information about the version of OpenPanel currently installed on your system, as well as the latest available version.

- **Installed Version:** Shows the version of OpenPanel currently running.

- **Latest Version:** Shows the most recent version available for update.

If the installed version matches the latest version, OpenPanel is fully up to date. If not, you can initiate a manual update via a button to upgrade to the latest version.

## Auto Updates
The Auto Updates section lets you configure how OpenPanel should handle updates automatically.
You can select the update policy that best fits your needs:

- **Minor Versions Only:** Automatically apply updates that include only bug fixes and security patches. Major feature updates must be installed manually.

- **Both Minor and Major Versions:** Automatically apply all updates, including new features, bug fixes, and security enhancements.

- **Major Versions Only:** Automatically apply updates that introduce major new features. Bug fixes and security patches will require manual updates.

- **Never:** Disable automatic updates. You will need to manually check for and install all updates.

Choosing the appropriate auto-update setting ensures that OpenPanel remains as stable, secure, and feature-rich as you need it to be.

## Update Logs
The Update Logs section provides a record of all updates that have been applied to OpenPanel.
