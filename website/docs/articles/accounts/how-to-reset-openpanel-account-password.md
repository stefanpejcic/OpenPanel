   > **NOTE:** If the **Forgot Password?** link does not appear on the login form, email-based password reset is disabled by your hosting provider. In this case, you must either:
   >
   > 1. Auto-login to OpenPanel through their billing panel and reset your password via [Account > Settings](/docs/panel/account/#changing-password), or
   > 2. Contact your hosting provider to reset the password for you.

2. Enter your **email address** and click **Send Reset Link**.
