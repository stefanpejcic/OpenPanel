##  Reserved usernames

OpenPanel reserves some usernames for the system’s use, and you cannot use them for OpenPanel accounts. This list of reserved usernames can grow over time, and new versions of OpenPanel may add to this list.

OpenPanel checks the following file to determine whether to reserve or restrict a username:

```bash
/etc/openpanel/openadmin/config/forbidden_usernames.txt
```
