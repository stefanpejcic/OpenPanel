# MySQL, MariaDB, or Percona

When creating a user, you can select which MySQL-compatible database type to use:

* **MySQL**
* **MariaDB**

Users also have the *Change MySQL Type* option, which allows switching between these types after creation.

Administrators can configure the default database type for new users from [**OpenAdmin > Settings > User Defaults**](/docs/admin/settings/defaults/).
