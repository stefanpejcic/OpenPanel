## How to Transfer an Account

### Using OpenAdmin

1. Navigate to **OpenAdmin > Users**.
2. Click on the user you want to transfer.
3. Under the **Transfer** section, fill in the remote server details:
   
   * **Server**: IP address or domain name of the remote server
   * **Port**: SSH port (usually `22`)
   * **Username**: SSH username for the remote server (usually `root`)
   * **Password**: SSH password for the specified user

5. (Optional) Enable the **Live Transfer** option.
   If checked, the account will be suspended on the current server after migration, and DNS will be forwarded to the new server.

6. Click **Start Transfer**.

Once initiated, the transfer process will begin. A log file will be generated - click on its name to view live progress.

### Using Terminal

To transfer an OpenPanel account to another server from the terminal, use the following command:

```bash
opencli user-transfer --account <OPENPANEL_USER> --host <DESTINATION_IP> --username <SSH_USERNAME> --password <DESTINATION_SSH_PASSWORD> [--live-transfer]
```

If the destination server uses a custom SSH port, include the `--port` flag, for example:

```bash
--port 2222
```

To use SSH key authentication instead of a password, simply omit the `--password` flag. Ensure that your SSH key is already configured on the destination server and verify the connection by running:

```bash
ssh root@<DESTINATION_IP>
```
