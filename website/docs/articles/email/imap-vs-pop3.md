# IMAP vs POP3

ðŸ“¬ POP3 vs IMAP: Email Access Protocols

**POP3** and **IMAP** are two distinct protocols for accessing email stored on a server.

* **POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)** was introduced in **[1996](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt)**. Itâ€™s designed for environments with limited internet connectivity and minimal server storage. It downloads emails to a local device and typically removes them from the server afterwardâ€”making it ideal for older dial-up connections.

* **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** came later in **[2003](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501)**, evolving alongside persistent broadband connections (like cable or DSL). IMAP stores emails on the server and synchronizes their status (read, unread, replied, labeled, etc.) across all devices. This makes it ideal for modern use across phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Key Differences

| Feature               | **IMAP**                        | **POP3**                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Mail Storage**      | Stays on the **server**         | Downloaded to the **local device**             |
| **Synchronization**   | Yes â€“ across all devices        | No â€“ removed from server once accessed*       |
| **Sent Mail**         | Stored on **server**            | Stored on **device**                           |
| **Deleted Mail**      | Goes to Trash (must be emptied) | Removed from device only (no effect on server) |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Yes â€“ via server backups        | No â€“ stored only locally                       |
| **Offline Access**    | No â€“ requires Internet          | Yes â€“ once downloaded                          |

> * POP3 **can** be configured to leave messages on the server, but this often leads to duplicate emails across devices and is not recommended. Use IMAP for proper syncing.

## Which is right for me?

**Choose IMAP** â€“ itâ€™s the modern standard and the best option for most users. It allows full synchronization across all devices and ensures that your email stays safe and accessible on the server.

**Choose POP3** only if:

* You have **limited internet access**
* You **must** access your email **offline**
* Server storage is severely restricted
