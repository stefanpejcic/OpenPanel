## OpenPanel

### Whitelist FOSSBilling

Before you can setup the OpenPanel server manager in FOSSBilling, you need to first whitelist your FOSSBilling server's IP address inside of OpenAdmin interface, and enable API access. 

To enable access to the FOSSBilling server's IP, first check the ip address on that server, from terminal you can run:

```bash
curl ip.openpanel.com
```

Login to OpenAdmin and under **Settings > Firewall** add the FOSSBilling server's IP under **Allow IP address**:
