# WHMCS

OpenPanel Enterprise edition has billing integrations with WHMCS and [FOSSBilling](/docs/articles/extensions/openpanel-and-fossbilling).

OpenPanel WHMCS module allows users to integrate billing automations with their OpenPanel server.

# OpenPanel 

To setup WHMCS to use your OpenPanel server follow these steps:

## Enable API

First make sure that API access is enabled by going to `OpenAdmin > API` or by running `opencli config get api` from the terminal:

If API is not enabled, click on the "Enable API access" button or from terminal run 
```bash
opencli config update api on
```

We recommend creating new Administrator user for API, to create a new user navigate to *OpenAdmin > OpenAdmin Settings* and create new admin user, or from terminal run:
```bash
opencli admin new USERNAME_HERE PASSWORD_HERE
```

## Whitelist on OpenPanel

On OpenPanel server make sure that the OpenAdmin port 2087 is open on `OpenAdmin > Firewall` or whitelist the IP address of your WHMCS server.
to whitelist ip address from terminal run:

```bash
csf -a WHMCS_IP_HERE
```
or if using UFS:
```bash
ufw allow from WHMCS_IP_HERE
```

## Create hosting package
Hosting packages need to be created on both OpenPanel and WHMCS servers.
On OpenPanel server login to admin panel and on `OpenAdmin > Plans` create hosting packages that you will be assigning to users on WHMCS.

# WHMCS
