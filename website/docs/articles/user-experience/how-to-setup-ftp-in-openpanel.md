# Setup FTP

[OpenPanel Enterprise](https://openpanel.com/enterprise/) supports FTP access. Once enabled, a shared FTP server becomes available for all users.

Follow these steps to enable FTP in OpenPanel:

---

## 1. Activate the Enterprise License

Ensure that you're running the **Enterprise Edition** of OpenPanel. FTP support is only available in this version.

## 2. Enable the FTP Module

OpenPanel uses a modular system where features can be individually enabled or disabled.

To enable the FTP module:

* Go to **OpenAdmin > Settings > Modules**
* Find the **FTP** module and click **Activate**

* Select the feature set you want to modify
* Enable the **ftp** feature

## Troubleshooting

If a user sees the following error:

> `FTP service is not yet started, please contact Administrator to enable it.`

It means the FTP service is not running. Revisit **Step 3: Start the FTP Service** to resolve this.
