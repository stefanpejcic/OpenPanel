# Setup Email

[OpenPanel Enterprise](https://openpanel.com/enterprise/) supports Emails. Once enabled, a shared Email server becomes available for all users.

Follow these steps to enable Emails in OpenPanel:

---

## 1. Activate the Enterprise License

Ensure that you're running the **Enterprise Edition** of OpenPanel. Email support is only available in this version.
