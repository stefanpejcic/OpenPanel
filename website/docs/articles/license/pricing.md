# OpenPanel Pricing

OpenPanel is available in two editions:

- **OpenPanel Community** is a free version of the panel that is limited to 3 user accounts and 50 domains, which should be more than enough for personal use.
- **OpenPanel Enterprise** unlocks premium features for user isolation and management, suitable for web hosting providers. It has API access and can easily be integrated with 3rd party billing tools like WHMCS and FOSSBilling.
