# 403 Error Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers the most common causes of **403 Forbidden** errors on a website and how to resolve them.

---

## 1. Coraza WAF

One of the most common causes is the **Coraza WAF** blocking access according to **ModSecurity CoreRuleSet** rules.

1. Navigate to **Advanced > WAF** in your hosting control panel.

2. Check if WAF is enabled for the domain. Temporarily disable it, then test the website to confirm if WAF is the cause.

3. If WAF is the issue:

   * **Not recommended:** Leave WAF disabled for the domain.
   * **Better option:** Identify the exact rule being triggered and disable only that rule.

4. To find the rule:

   * Click **View Logs** to open ModSecurity logs.
   * Search for your 403 request by IP, time, or request details.
   * Note the **Rule ID**.

5. Go to **Manage Rules** for the domain in the WAF section:

   * Disable by Rule ID: [SecRuleRemoveByID](https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/directives/#secruleremovebyid)
   * Disable by Tag: [SecRuleRemoveByTag](https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/directives/#secruleremovebytag)

6. Re-enable WAF and retest the website.

## 2. WordPress

Content management systems like **WordPress** use `.htaccess` files that may block access.

1. Temporarily rename or remove the `.htaccess` file in your website’s root directory.
2. Create a simple test file (e.g., `index.php`) and open it in the browser.
3. If it loads, the issue is CMS-related.
4. Possible fixes:

   * Disable WordPress plugins temporarily.
   * Restore the default `.htaccess` file.
   * Seek help on your CMS forums or [OpenPanel Community](https://community.openpanel.org/).

## 3. File Permissions

Incorrect file ownership or permissions can also trigger 403 errors.

1. Open **File Manager** and navigate to the domain’s directory.

2. Click **Options** and enable **Owner** and **Group** columns.

3. Ensure all files have the same owner and group.

4. Check file and folder permissions.

5. If ownership is incorrect, use **Files > Fix Permissions** to restore defaults.

## 4. Sensitive files

By default, webserver blocks access to sensitive files:

```
.git
composer.json
composer.lock
auth.json
config.php
wp-config.php
vendor
```

If you are sure you want these files accessible (not recommended), edit the domain’s VHost configuration.

### For OpenResty / Nginx:

```nginx
# <!-- BEGIN EXPOSED RESOURCES PROTECTION -->
location ~* ^/(\.git|composer\.(json|lock)|auth\.json|config\.php|wp-config\.php|vendor) {
    deny all;
    return 403;
}
# <!-- END EXPOSED RESOURCES PROTECTION -->
```

### For Apache:

```apache
# <!-- BEGIN EXPOSED RESOURCES PROTECTION -->
<Directory <DOCUMENT_ROOT>>
    <FilesMatch "\.(git|composer\.(json|lock)|auth\.json|config\.php|wp-config\.php|vendor)">
        Require all denied
    </FilesMatch>
</Directory>
# <!-- END EXPOSED RESOURCES PROTECTION -->
```
