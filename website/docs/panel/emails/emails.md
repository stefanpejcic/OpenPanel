# Email Accounts

If the **Emails** module is enabled on the server and your user account has access, you'll see a table listing all current email domains, the total number of domains, a search bar, and an option to add a new domain.

- The total number of email accounts is displayed at the top left.  
- A search bar is available on the top right for quick filtering.

From this interface, you can view all your email accounts and their details:

* **Email Address**  
* **Storage Used**: size in GB  
* **Manage**: Options for Webmail, Account Management, and Device Connections
