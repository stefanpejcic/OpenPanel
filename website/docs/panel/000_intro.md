# Get Started

OpenPanel is the main control panel for managing your web services. From OpenPanel, you can create and manage domains, email accounts, website content, SQL databases, and other server-related services.

## Log in to OpenPanel

By default, OpenPanel is accessible via your serverâ€™s IP address on port `2083`. Administrators may also configure a custom domain and port.  

To log in:

1. Open the link provided by your hosting provider.
2. Enter your assigned **username** and **password**.

## Password Reset

If you forget your password, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Forgot password?** link on the login page.

   > **NOTE:** If the **Forgot Password?** link does not appear on the login form, email-based password reset is disabled by your hosting provider. In this case, you must either:
   >
   > 1. Log in automatically to OpenPanel through their billing panel and reset your password via [Account > Settings](/docs/panel/account/#changing-password), or
   > 2. Contact your hosting provider to reset the password for you.

2. Enter your **email address** and click **Send Reset Link**.
