# Trash

When deleting files you can select to permanently delete them, or to place them in the Trash (default option).
The **Trash** page allows you to manage deleted.

In the table, you can see the following information:

* **Name**
* **Size** – Displays the size for files. For folders, click **Calculate** to fetch their size.
* **Deletion Date** – Shows the timestamp when the file was deleted.
* **Original Path** – Displays where the file was located before delete.
* **Permissions** – Displays symbolic file permissions (e.g., `drwxr-xr-x`). Hover over them to view the octal (numeric) equivalent (e.g., `0755`).

Clicking the **Toggle** icon reveals additional details:

* **Owner** – The UID of the file or folder owner.
* **Group** – The GID of the group that owns the file or folder.
* **Links** – The number of hard links to the file or directory.
* **Link Target** – If it’s a symlink, this shows the target it points to.
* **Type** – Indicates whether it's a directory, file, or symbolic link.
