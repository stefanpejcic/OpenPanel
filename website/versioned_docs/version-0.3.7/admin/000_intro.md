## Installation

OpenPanel can be installed on both VPS and bare-metal servers. 

### Install OpenPanel on VPS

The installation process takes about 5 minutes. To install openpanel follow these steps: 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="openpanel-install-on-dedicated" label="Install script" default>

1. Log in to your new server;
- as root via SSH or
- as a user with sudo privileges and type "sudo -i"
2. Copy and paste openpanel installation command into the terminal
```shell
bash <(curl -sSL https://openpanel.org)
```

The installation script supports [optional flags](/install) that can be used to configure openpanel, skip certain installation steps or simply display debugging information.

If you encountered any errors while running the installation script, please copy & paste the installation log file to [the community forums](https://community.openpanel.org).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="openpanel-install-on-digitalocean" label="DigitalOcean Droplet">

OpenPanel is available as a 1-Click app (droplet) on DigitalOcean. Click on the button to spin a droplet with OpenPanel already installed:

     -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
    '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"nyc3","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"openpanel"}' \
    "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing OpenPanel on a bare-metal server

When installing OpenPanel on a bare-metal server, it is recommended to format the disk with the XFS filesystem and enable the 'pquota' mount option. This is required for Docker's OverlayFS storage driver to function properly, as it allows setting user quotas and limiting container sizes on newer kernels. More details on these requirements can be found in the [Docker OverlayFS documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/drivers/overlayfs-driver/#prerequisites).

If your disk is not formatted with XFS, the OpenPanel installation script will automatically allocate 50% of the available storage. It will then create an XFS storage file and mount it at `/var/lib/docker/`. This process may take a considerable amount of time on servers with large storage capacities (e.g., several terabytes). In such cases, we recommend manually setting the filesystem to XFS or adjusting the storage file size. Alternatively, you can specify a custom size during installation by using the `--docker-space` flag. For instance, to allocate only 100GB for Docker, you can use: `--docker-space=100`.

To install OpenPanel on a bare-metal server:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="openpanel-install-on-baremetal" label="Allocate 50% of disk to Docker" default>

```shell
bash <(curl -sSL https://openpanel.org)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="openpanel-install-on-baremetal-size" label="Set disk size for Docker (faster install)">

*replace `250` with the disk size in GB to allocate to Docker.

```shell
bash <(curl -sSL https://openpanel.org) --docker-space=250
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


The installation script supports [additional flags](/install) that can be used to configure openpanel, skip certain installation steps or simply display debugging information.

If you encountered any errors while running the installation script, please copy & paste the installation log file to [the community forums](https://community.openpanel.org).


## Post Install Steps

Recommended steps after installing OpenPanel:
- [access admin panel](/docs/admin/intro#access-openadmin)
- [set domain for accessing panels](/docs/admin/settings/general/#set-domain-for-openpanel)
- [set custom nameservers](/docs/admin/settings/openpanel/#set-nameservers)
- [create a hosting plan](/docs/admin/plans/hosting_plans#create-a-plan)
- [create a new user account](/docs/admin/users/openpanel#create-users)
- [set admin email for server alerts](/docs/admin/notifications/#email-alerts)

### Access OpenAdmin

Run `opencli admin` command to find the address on which admin panel is accessible. Example output:

```bash
root@server:/home# opencli admin
● AdminPanel is running and is available on: https://server.openpanel.co:2087/
```

To login to admin panel you need a username and password.

![openadmin login page](/img/admin/openadmin_login_page.png)

Both username and password are random generated on installation.

To view admin accounts:

```bash
opencli admin list
```

To set a new password for the admin account run command: `opencli admin password USER_HERE NEW_PASSWORD_HERE`

Example:
```bash
root@server:/home# opencli admin password stefan ba63vfav7fq36vas
Password for user 'stefan' changed.

===============================================================
● AdminPanel is running and is available on: https://server.openpanel.co:2087/

- username: stefan
- password: ba63vfav7fq36vas

===============================================================
```

### Enable Automatic Updates

- `autopatch` option allows Administrator to automatically update OpenPanel to minor versions. MINOR versions include only security updates and bug fixes.

## License

OpenPanel is available in two editions:

- [**OpenPanel Community edition**](/product/openpanel-free-control-panel/) is a free version of the panel that is limited to 3 user accounts and 50 domains, which should be more than enough for personal use.
- [**OpenPanel Enterprise edition**](/product/openpanel-premium-control-panel/) unlocks premium features for user isolation and management, suitable for web hosting providers. It has API access and can easily be integrated with 3rd party billing tools like WHMCS and FOSSBilling.

## Security

OpenPanel has been built from the ground up with security in mind. Internet history is littered with painful security incidents, so we traded old software compatibility and insecure authentication methods for modern day security measures.


### Firewall
OpenPanel supports both [ConfigServer & Firewall (CSF)](/docs/admin/security/firewall/#csf) and [UncomplicatedFirewall (UFW)](/docs/admin/security/firewall/#ufw).


### Isolated Services
Each user is provided with a containerized environment similar to a VPS, featuring their own web server (Nginx or Apache) and database (MySQL or MariaDB). This setup prevents resource hogging commonly associated with standard shared hosting.


### Two-Factor Authentication
Users have the option to [enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](/docs/panel/account/2fa/) for added security on their accounts. Administrators can manage this feature at the server level or for individual users.

### Detailed Logging
All actions taken by OpenPanel users are recorded in per-user activity logs. This eliminates confusion over issues like file or webmail account deletions—every action is logged and can be reviewed by users.

### Isolated Users and Admin
OpenPanel and OpenAdmin operate independently from one another. One runs as a systemd service while the other runs as a Docker container. OpenPanel utilizes SQLite for its database, whereas OpenAdmin relies on MySQL. Importantly, users can perform actions on their panel even if the admin panel is unreachable or disabled.


### Disabling the Admin Panel
For production environments, particularly with the Community edition—which does not offer API access and lacks third-party integrations—it is advisable to disable the admin panel after configuring your server. Alternatively, you can restrict access to the admin port `2087` by whitelisting your team's IP addresses.

To disable OpenAdmin, navigate to **OpenAdmin > Settings > OpenAdmin** and click on *"Disable Admin Panel"* or use the terminal command `opencli admin off`. This will deactivate the admin panel, and you can re-enable it when necessary with the command `opencli admin on`.

### Limiting Access to Admin Panel
To restrict OpenAdmin access to your team, whitelist your server's IP addresses in CSF/UFW, and then disable port `2087`.

### HTTP Basic Authentication
As an additional security measure, HTTP Basic Authentication can be enabled for the admin panel.

### Brute-Force Protection

Both user and admin interfaces have a built-in rate limiting and IP address blocking to protect against brute-force attacks. You can configure the maximum number of failed login attempts allowed per IP (default is `5` per minute) and the total number of failed attempts (default is `20`), after which the offending IP will be temporarily blocked by the firewall for one hour.

For user panel imits are configurable in: `/etc/openpanel/openpanel/conf/openpanel.config` file:
```bash
[USERS]
login_ratelimit=5
login_blocklimit=20
```

![user ratelimit](/img/panel/v1/user_block.png)

For admin panel imits are configurable in: `/etc/openpanel/openadmin/config/admin.ini` file:
```bash
[PANEL]
login_ratelimit=5
login_blocklimit=20
```

![admin ratelimit](/img/admin/admin_block.png)

If a user successfully logs in, the counter for `login_blocklimit` will reset.
Failed login attempts and blocked IP addresses are logged in the `/var/log/openpanel/admin/failed_login.log` file for OpenAdmin and in the `/var/log/openpanel/user/failed_login.log` file for OpenPanel.

### IP blocking per domain

Users can block IP addresses per domain name.
