OpenPanel now supports all major RHEL Distributions: AlmaLinux, Fedora, RockyLinux and CentOS

<!--truncate-->


Starting from OpenPanel [0.2.6](/docs/changelog/0.2.6/) the following OS are supported:

- **AlmaLinux 9.5**
- **RockyLinux 9.3**
- **CentOS 9**
- **Ubuntu 22 and 24**
- **Debian 11 and 12**

### A Control Panel for All

OpenPanel has always been about flexibility, and with these new additions, we are making sure that our users have the freedom to choose the OS that best fits their needs. 
Whether you're running the latest version of Fedora, managing servers on Ubuntu, or maintaining systems on RockyLinux, OpenPanel s here to provide you with a consistent and reliable experience across all these platforms.

### Seamless Cross-OS Migration

One of the standout features of OpenPanel 0.2.6+ is its enhanced portability. Thanks to the groundwork laid in versions [0.2.5](/docs/changelog/0.2.5/#-new-features) and [0.1.7](/docs/changelog/0.1.7/#containerized-services), you can now effortlessly move your OpenPanel data between different operating systems. This cross-OS compatibility means you can migrate from one Linux distribution to another with zero downtime, making it easier to manage end-of-life (EOL) transitions or simply upgrade to a newer OS without disrupting your operations.

### Future-Proof Your Infrastructure

Operating system lifecycles can be a challenge, especially when an OS reaches its EOL and can no longer be upgraded. With OpenPanel 0.2.6+, this is no longer a concern.
If your current OS is nearing EOL and upgrading isn't an option, simply copy your OpenPanel data to a new server running a supported OS, and you'll be back up and running in no time. 
This capability ensures that OpenPanel remains a future-proof solution for your server management needs.
