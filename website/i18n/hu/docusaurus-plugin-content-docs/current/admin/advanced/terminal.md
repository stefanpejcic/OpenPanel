# Terminal

The Web Terminal is available in **OpenAdmin**, allowing Super Administrators to manage their server environments directly from the browser.

1. Log in to your OpenAdmin panel.
2. Navigate to **Advanced > Terminal**.
3. Use the dropdown menu or selector to choose your preferred shell type: `sh` or `bash`.
4. The terminal interface will load, and you can begin typing commands immediately.

Limitations:
- Web terminal is not interactive.
- File uploads are not supported through the terminal.

:::info 
Starting with OpenPanel 1.7.1, the web terminal is available only to the Super Admin. Other Admin users will no longer have access.
To completely disable the Web Terminal, including for Super Admin, see [How to disable the Terminal feature in OpenAdmin](/docs/articles/dev-experience/disable-openadmin-web-terminal/)
